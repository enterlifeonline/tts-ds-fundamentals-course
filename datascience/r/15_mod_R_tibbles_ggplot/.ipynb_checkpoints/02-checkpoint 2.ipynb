    "The use of ```renderText``` and ```renderPlot``` to generate output (rather than just assigning values directly) is what makes the application reactive. These reactive wrappers return special expressions that are only re-executed when their dependencies change. This behavior is what enables Shiny to automatically update output whenever input changes."
