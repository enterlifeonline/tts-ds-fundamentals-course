    "The code is straightforward. Each model is represented by a class that subclasses `django.db.models.Model`. Each model has a number of class variables, each of which represents a database field in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each field is represented by an instance of a `Field` class – e.g., `CharField` for character fields and `DateTimeField` for datetimes. This tells Django what type of data each field holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of each `Field` instance (e.g. `question` or `pub_date` ) is the field’s name, in machine-friendly format. You’ll use this value in your Python code, and your database will use it as the column name.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use an optional first positional argument to a Field to designate a human-readable name. That’s used in a couple of introspective parts of Django, and it doubles as documentation. If this field isn’t provided, Django will use the machine-readable name. In this example, we’ve only defined a human-readable name for `Poll.pub_date`. For all other fields in this model, the field’s machine-readable name will suffice as its human-readable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some Field classes have required arguments. `CharField`, for example, requires that you give it a `max_length`. That’s used not only in the database schema, but in validation, as we’ll soon see.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Field` can also have various optional arguments; in this case, we’ve set the default value of votes to 0.\n",

    "* Table names are automatically generated by combining the name of the app (polls) and the lowercase name of the model – poll and choice. (You can override this behavior.)\n",
    "* Primary keys (IDs) are added automatically. (You can override this, too.)\n",
    "* By convention, Django appends \"_id\" to the foreign key field name. (Yes, you can override this, as well.)\n",
    "* The foreign key relationship is made explicit by a REFERENCES statement.\n",
    "* It’s tailored to the database you’re using, so database-specific field types such as auto_increment (MySQL), serial (PostgreSQL), or integer primary key (SQLite) are handled for you automatically. Same goes for quoting of field names – e.g., using double quotes or single quotes. The author of this tutorial runs PostgreSQL, so the example output is in PostgreSQL syntax.\n",

If you wanted to, you could copy and paste this SQL into your database prompt. However, as we will see shortly, Django provides an easier way of committing the SQL to the database.\n",

    "    # ...\n",
    "    list_display = ('question', 'pub_date', 'was_published_recently')\n",
    "Now the poll change list page looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Polls change list page, updated\n",
    "You can click on the column headers to sort by those values – except in the case of the was_published_recently header, because sorting by the output of an arbitrary method is not supported. Also note that the column header for was_published_recently is, by default, the name of the method (with underscores replaced with spaces), and that each line contains the string representation of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can improve that by giving that method (in polls/models.py) a few attributes, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "import datetime\n",
    "from django.utils import timezone\n",
    "from django.db import models\n",
    "\n",
    "from polls.models import Poll\n",
    "\n",
    "class Poll(models.Model):\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    def was_published_recently(self):\n",
    "        return self.pub_date >= timezone.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=1)\n",
    "    was_published_recently.admin_order_field = 'pub_date'\n",
    "    was_published_recently.boolean = True\n",
    "    was_published_recently.short_description = 'Published recently?'\n",
    "Edit your polls/admin.py file again and add an improvement to the Poll change list page: Filters. Add the following line to PollAdmin:\n",
    "\n",
    "list_filter = ['pub_date']\n",
    "That adds a “Filter” sidebar that lets people filter the change list by the pub_date field:\n",
    "\n",
    "Polls change list page, updated\n",
    "The type of filter displayed depends on the type of field you’re filtering on. Because pub_date is a DateTimeField, Django knows to give appropriate filter options: “Any date,” “Today,” “Past 7 days,” “This month,” “This year.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This is shaping up well. Let’s add some search capability:\n",
    "\n",
    "search_fields = ['question']\n",
    "That adds a search box at the top of the change list. When somebody enters search terms, Django will search the question field. You can use as many fields as you’d like – although because it uses a LIKE query behind the scenes, keep it reasonable, to keep your database happy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, because Poll objects have dates, it’d be convenient to be able to drill down by date. Add this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "date_hierarchy = 'pub_date'\n",
    "That adds hierarchical navigation, by date, to the top of the change list page. At top level, it displays all available years. Then it drills down to months and, ultimately, days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now’s also a good time to note that change lists give you free pagination. The default is to display 100 items per page. Change-list pagination, search boxes, filters, date-hierarchies and column-header-ordering all work together like you think they should.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customize the admin look and feel\n",
    "Clearly, having “Django administration” at the top of each admin page is ridiculous. It’s just placeholder text.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s easy to change, though, using Django’s template system. The Django admin is powered by Django itself, and its interfaces use Django’s own template system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customizing your project’s templates\n",
    "Create a templates directory in your project directory. Templates can live anywhere on your filesystem that Django can access. (Django runs as whatever user your server runs.) However, keeping your templates within the project is a good convention to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open your settings file (mysite/settings.py, remember) and add a TEMPLATE_DIRS setting:\n",
    "\n",
    "TEMPLATE_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')]\n",
    "TEMPLATE_DIRS is an iterable of filesystem directories to check when loading Django templates; it’s a search path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now create a directory called admin inside templates, and copy the template admin/base_site.html from within the default Django admin template directory in the source code of Django itself (django/contrib/admin/templates) into that directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where are the Django source files?\n",
    "If you have difficulty finding where the Django source files are located on your system, run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "python -c \"\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "sys.path = sys.path[1:]\n",
    "import django\n",
    "print(django.__path__)\"\n",
    "Then, just edit the file and replace the generic Django text with your own site’s name as you see fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "This template file contains lots of text like {% block branding %} and {{ title }}. The {% and {{ tags are part of Django’s template language. When Django renders admin/base_site.html, this template language will be evaluated to produce the final HTML page. Don’t worry if you can’t make any sense of the template right now – we’ll delve into Django’s templating language in Tutorial 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that any of Django’s default admin templates can be overridden. To override a template, just do the same thing you did with base_site.html – copy it from the default directory into your custom directory, and make changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customizing your application’s templates\n",
    "Astute readers will ask: But if TEMPLATE_DIRS was empty by default, how was Django finding the default admin templates? The answer is that, by default, Django automatically looks for a templates/ subdirectory within each application package, for use as a fallback (don’t forget that django.contrib.admin is an application).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our poll application is not very complex and doesn’t need custom admin templates. But if it grew more sophisticated and required modification of Django’s standard admin templates for some of its functionality, it would be more sensible to modify the application’s templates, rather than those in the project. That way, you could include the polls application in any new project and be assured that it would find the custom templates it needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the template loader documentation for more information about how Django finds its templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customize the admin index page\n",
    "On a similar note, you might want to customize the look and feel of the Django admin index page.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, it displays all the apps in INSTALLED_APPS that have been registered with the admin application, in alphabetical order. You may want to make significant changes to the layout. After all, the index is probably the most important page of the admin, and it should be easy to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The template to customize is admin/index.html. (Do the same as with admin/base_site.html in the previous section – copy it from the default directory to your custom template directory.) Edit the file, and you’ll see it uses a template variable called app_list. That variable contains every installed Django app. Instead of using that, you can hard-code links to object-specific admin pages in whatever way you think is best. Again, don’t worry if you can’t understand the template language – we’ll cover that in more detail in Tutorial 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you’re comfortable with the admin site, read part 3 of this tutorial to start working on public poll views."
